# Kotlin-Appretice-2nd-Ed-Challenges
I'm uploading my solutions to the challenges found in Kotlin Apprentice 2nd edition as I work my way through the book.  

I am self teaching myself programming with this book.  You can use these to check or compare your answers.

Please comment with questions or if I can condense my code to be more effecient.  Remember that I am trying to use only the coding tools that have been taught so far.
